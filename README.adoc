This repository contains example projects to interact with Spring HATEOAS.

* Learn how to interact with a Spring HATEOAS-powered app, from inside as well as the command line.
* See how to upgrade a REST resource without having to create new mediatypes, version URIs, etc.

We have separate folders for each of these:

== Spring HATEOAS Modules

* link:basics[Basics] - Poke and prod at a hypermedia-powered service from inside the code as well as externally using standard tools
* link:api-evolution[API Evolution] - Upgrade an existing REST resource
* link:hypermedia[Hypermedia] - Create hypermedia-driven REST resources, linking them together, and supporting older links.
